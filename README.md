this project I will eyeball/sightread a webpage and try to reconstruct it visually. There will be no working links or functional scripts beyond aesthetics. I will take a "good enough" approach and not be too picky if things aren't perfect, I'm more concerned about proper page layound and placement versus correct buttons and icons. That would take far too long to get that perfect.

What I learned? I brushed up on some CSS and HTML, which was much needed. I found the header particularly difficult to get centered, I learned I need to study more into FLEX containers to understand how they work.

 I thought about really focusing on making the search bar and buttons look identical, but decided that it wasn't worth my time. That would have been doable, just a lot of trial and error with the sight reading challenge of the google homepage.

future project ideas: tinder for food.
